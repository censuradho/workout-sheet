## ğŸ¤” What it is for?
Anyone who has trained in a gym and had their training tape lost, wet or even damaged by time knows that it is not comfortable to use a paper tape to have a track record of your training progress. With this pain, I decided to create this App to centralize my workouts, be able to view from wherever I want and have future progress reports.
